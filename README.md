# âš¡ Electricity Consumption Forecasting with Time Series Models

This project focuses on forecasting electricity consumption using Time Series models including **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **LSTM**. The goal is to compare and evaluate classical statistical models with deep learning approaches to improve forecasting accuracy and understand energy usage patterns.

## ðŸ“ˆ Models Used

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Suitable for univariate time series with trend.
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** Extension of ARIMA to handle seasonality in the data.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, ideal for sequential data.


## Dataset Zipped

- **Before using the streamlit extract it first the dataset
